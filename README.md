Current goals:
- resolve issue with framebuffer when window size changes
- fix color adjustment on Earth and its atmosphere due to the bloom pass making such slightly desaturated
- resolve issue with Framebuffer class so the FBOs do not need to be hardcoded in Main
- then finish importing remaining planetary bodies and begin configuring their orbits and rotations
